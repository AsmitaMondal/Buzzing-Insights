## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive exploration of honeybee ecology and honey production, incorporating image data analysis, predictive modeling, and ecological inference. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, insights into the intricate interactions between honeybees, flowering plants, and honey production dynamics have been gained, with accuracies exceeding 90% for binary as well as multiclass classification models. Notably, image classification techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks facilitated the identification of pollen-carrying honeybees with an accuracy of 91%, while predictive models for honey price estimation, particularly utilizing XGBoost, demonstrated exceptional performance with an R2 score of 0.99. Further, comparative studies were implemented for regression models as well as dimensionality reduction effects for optimization of the algorithms. The findings from this project hold significant implications for biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture practices, and the overall sustainability and profitability of the honey production industry. The project was carried out in the Kaggle Notebook powered by the TensorFlow GPU.
